Ethereum is a crypto-currency developed by Vitalik Buterin in 2015 and is a cryptograph based on a blockchain like Bitcoin. However, Etherium has built a decentralization platform based on Smart Contract, which is different from Bitcoin, and it moves away from a simple payment system that acts as a crypto-currency counterpart. Smart contract allow Ethereum to handle many types of work on its own and provide flexible scalability. Smart contract means contracting automatically without going through the hands of people when the contract conditions are met. It is a technology with great danger because the contract is concluded when the condition is satisfied regardless of the intention of the contractor. This is because the safety of smart contracts depends on 100% developer capacity. In this paper, we show the weakness of smart contract by showing the operation of Ethereum smart contract based on web3 by modulating data through sql injection.
